and hard-working nature make him an excellent software developer -- for example, when analyzing a 
section of code, he not only understands the top level , but endeavors to find and explore every 
library reference, paradigmatic decision, and code formatting standard he finds unclear.  Not only 
does he generate code that is easily merged, he also improves upon and questioning current code.  
He's welcome as a developer on any code base I manage." %}
